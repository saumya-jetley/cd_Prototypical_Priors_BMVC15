# cdPrototypicalPriorsBMVC15
The code for BMVC15 submission - leveraging prototypical priors for classification to zero shot learning

- The network architecture definitions can be found within the 'archi_definitions' folder.

- Their categorisation is as follows:

	- baseline models -->  baseline_dnn*.*
	- baseline ZSL models --> 		baseline_zsl*.*
	- prototypically enhanced models -->	prototyp_*.*		
	- prototypically enhanced ZSL models --> prototyp?_zsl*.*

- The log files of prototypically enhanced model training for GTSD (traffic signs) and BELGA (logo dataset) can be found in the log_files folder.
